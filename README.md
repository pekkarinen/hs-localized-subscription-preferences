# hs-localized-subscription-preferences
JS kludge to localize Hubspot email subscription preference system pages

NB. You need to add `?languagePreference={{ content.language.languageTag[0:2] }}`
to `unsubscribe_link_all` token in order to render in users language
ie. you need to whip up a custom footer for your e-mails

Have a nice day, the computer is your friend
